## Description of Project :grey_exclamation:
### This project, Rigid Frame Breakdown, will showcase a simulation of a rigid frame of a composite bridge and how it would hold up against falling object/blocks.

## Current Requirements :small_blue_diamond:
### This project currently uses no other external modules other than just pygame and random. Other than that, the modules needed will be inside the same folder as the main file that plays the pygame simulation. :+1:

## How to download this project :grey_question:
* ### Navigate to the main page of this github repository,

## How does this simulation work? :speech_balloon:
* ### Running the simulation, you will be greeted by some buttons
  ![Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/947963ff-228f-4b3b-a08d-5257f3f5153b)
* ### There will be a "``Start``," "``Stop``," "``Undo``," and a "``Reset``" button
* ### By pressing the ``space bar``, objects with different masses will spawn above composite bridge
* ### The "``Start``" button will allow the created objects to begin falling
* ### The "``Stop``" button will stop the simulation and the falling objects
* ### The "``Undo``" button will delete the object that most recently spawned
* ### The "``Reset``" button will reset the entire simulation including the composite bridge and will clear all falling objects
* ### There is a logging system which will log certain events: Objects being spawned, objects colliding with a segment of the composite bridge, and the force of the object when it collided with the bridge
